## Article
The article that I have selected for the assignment is is titled [We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here’s what it says.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/) and written by **Karen Hao** at ***MIT Technology Review***.

## About
This article discusses environmental and financial costs of natural language processing software models outlined in a paper by Timnit Gebru, a reknown AI ethics researcher and an ex co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, who was allegedly fired due to the arguments made in the paper.  
<br>
MIT Technology Review summarizes the content of the respective paper (not publicized) and discusses the following costs of large language models—AI software trained on huge amounts of text data:  
- Training large AI software consumes a lot of computing power and electricity, which results in large amounts of carbon emissions. The paper argues that AI language software largely benefit wealthy organizations, while climate change hits marginalized communities hardest. 
- Large language models aim at covering all the text data found on the internet, which might include discriminatory language and might fail to capture language and norms of countries with limited internet access.
- Language training models might be used to produce misleading information.

Although the whole situation regarding the case of Timnit Gebru might be quite controversial (especially for me due to my limited knowledge on the situation), this article might indeed provide an interesting perspective on costs of AI software.
