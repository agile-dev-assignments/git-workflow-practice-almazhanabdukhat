## Article
I have selected an article titled ***[We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here’s what it says](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/)*** written by **Karen Hao** at **MIT Technology Review**.

## About
This article discusses environmental and financial costs of natural language processing software models outlined in a paper by Timnit Gebru, a reknown AI ethics researcher and an ex co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, who has a conflict with the company due to the arguments made in the paper.  
<br>
MIT Technology Review summarizes the content of the respective paper (not publicized) and discusses the following costs of large language models—AI software trained on huge amounts of text data:  
- Training large AI software consumes a lot of computing power and electricity, which results in large amounts of carbon emissions. The paper argues that AI language software models largely benefit wealthy organizations, while climate change hits marginalized communities hardest. 
- Large language models aim at covering all the text data found on the internet, which might include discriminatory language and might fail to capture language and norms of countries with limited internet access.
- Language training models might be used to produce misleading information.

I have limited knowledge on the original conflict, but this article might indeed provide an interesting perspective on the costs of AI software and even an incentive for future researchers to consider sustainability in developing large scale software. <br><br>

**Ashley Sidoryk**: It's interesting to see how technology such as large natural language processing software models, which are intended to help and make aspects of life easier, have such negative after effects on the environment. Technology is aimed to create better living and yet, it has adverse effects by not being sustainable itself. Not only is this type of technology marketed in a way for betterment for the whole of society, but in reality it has holes which in turn, excludes certain groups of people as the languages they are trained with are not representative. As Almazhan also says, I hope that this conflict gives incentive for the discussion and discovery of more sustainable technologies that will benefit more communities equally.
